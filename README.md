I made this project's sprites on my own using piskel sprite painter and wrote the code from scratch (pun intended)! 
This project was created as a cs50 project in scratch block language!
Dont let the duck touch you! 
Controls:
use A and D to move and space to shoot the duck.Use your mouse pointer to direct the bullet towards duck.
important:Make sure your pointer is on the duck so that bullet can hit it and kill!
